### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ebert :smiley:. I am passionate about Machine Learning,
Deep Learning and Data Science :blue_heart:. I have worked on projects 
related to the medical field such as signal processing 
with sEMG, also I develop a system to predict bearing 
failures using deep learning tools.
I would like to connect with other people to solve 
challenges involving data and keep in touch to build a
great team. 
Do not hesitate to say hello ðŸ‘‹ in my social medias and let's build a great team :star:.
